#WRGL Pipeline
C# pipeline that runs on MiSeq completion and manages data through either panels of genotyping pipelines.


#network_running branch

duplicate on the MiSeq C:\ drives from the network drive.

Also want to look into centralising reference files (although larger, so this
may not be practical.)
